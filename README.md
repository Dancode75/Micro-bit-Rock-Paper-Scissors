# Quick User Guide

Begin by downloading and unzipping the main .zip file. 
Setup the Micro:bit using the files found in the same-named folder, or use the build in touch function to operate the program.

Plug the Micro:bit into your device and copy the .hex file into the Micro:bit's internals.

Once the program starts, press a and b together to begin the game.

Once the countdown ends, activate one of the pins to play.

Pin 0 is rock, pin 1 is paper, and pin 2 is scissors.

The game restarts once its finished, and only ends when you disconnect the Micro:bit from power.

The code is very unlabeled. Have fun trying to modify it.
